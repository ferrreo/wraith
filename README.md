# Unofficial Wayland Only Ghostty App Runtime

Disclaimer: this is an out of tree apprt which means it is not supported by the core Ghostty project. If you are using this application, you agree to participate in its development and report issues here before reporting them in the Ghostty GitHub (unless you know what you are doing)

To fill in links:

Ghostty module branch (used for now as no upstream support for Ghostty as a Zig module)

zig-wayland (automatically creates Wayland bindings)

libxev (event loop used)
